Ingredients
For the dough
160 ml water
235 g strong white flour
1 tablespoon olive oil, extra virgin
1 ½ teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon dry yeast
For the topping
200 ml passata
1 teaspoon dry basil
250 g low-fat mozzarella, well-drained
2 cans tuna in sunflower oil, very well-drained
1 small red onion, finely sliced
30 g black olives, pitted
Instructions
Make the dough
Add all the ingredients in the bread maker in the order recommended by the manufacturer and run the "dough" cycle. Some machines have a dedicated "pizza" setting. If yours has it, use that instead.
Alternatively, make the dough by hand by adding all the dry ingredients in a bowl, mix them well, and gradually add the olive oil and water until you have a dough that's now sticky. Leave it to prove for 1 – 1 ½ hours.
Assemble the pizza
Heat the oven at 230 degrees Celsius.
Mix the passata with the dry basil and season with salt and a pinch of black pepper.
Roll the dough as thin as possible without tearing it. Place it on a pizza tray.
Spread the sauce on the pizza.
Add the mozzarella, torn by hand. Follow with the tuna, onion, and olives. Spread everything as evenly as you can.
Bake for 20 minutes at 230 degrees Celsius or until the mozzarella is melted and the base is crisp.
Notes
When you roll the pizza dough very thin, it's possible to experience tearing. Finding the perfect thickness takes a bit of practice, so try again until you get it as thin as you prefer.
enjoy!!
