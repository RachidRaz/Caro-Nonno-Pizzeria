METHOD
1To make seafood pizza, first clean the mussels and soak alongside the clams in a basin of cold water for 20 minutes or so. Dissolve the yeast in 1 1/3 cups lukewarm water and work in to the flour with 1 tsp fine salt until a smooth dough is formed.
2Cover and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour. Stretch out the dough over a round, oiled pan (10” diameter) and bake for approximately 10 minutes in a fan oven at 480°F.
3Clean the mussels and clams by scrubbing the shells vigorously with a scourer under running water.
4In a large baking tray, place the mussels, clams, shrimp and crayfish, drizzle with oil, add one sprig of marjoram and one of thyme, and roast for 10 minutes in a fan oven at 480°F.
5Halve the tomatoes and dice the mozzarella. Scatter the cooked shellfish, tomatoes and mozzarella over the pizza and return to the oven at 480°F for a further 10 minutes.
6Remove the pizza from the oven, then add the sea bass and basil leaves and serve immediately.
